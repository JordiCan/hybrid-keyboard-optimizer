# hybrid-keyboard-optimizer
A hybrid optimization approach for keyboard layout design that combines Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing to find optimal key arrangements. The system evaluates layouts based on typing metrics such as finger travel distance, hand alternation, and common key combinations to create more ergonomic and efficient keyboard layouts.
