Rules for the Presentation of the Metaheuristic Techniques Project Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Digital Image The presentation of the projects carried out in the subject will be individual and in the group assigned at registration. The projects may be presented in two possible ways: a) In person in the laboratory class. The student will present their work using a PowerPoint or PDF file. After the presentation, they may receive comments from the professor or the students present. A selection of the students present will cross-evaluate their work. b) Asynchronous presentation using a recorded video, which will be uploaded to the UPV server. This video will subsequently be viewed and evaluated, in addition to by the professor, by a selection of the students of the subject. Before 18-09-2025, the chosen alternative must be informed to the practical teaching staff. Approach and Content of the Presentation The structure of the presentations will be similar, regardless of whether it is in person or asynchronously using video. The presentation should last approximately 8 minutes at the most (presentations that do not comply with this time frame will be penalized), so it should be concise. The structure of the presentation may vary depending on the problem and the chosen resolution techniques, but should follow this outline: 1. Description of the problem (1 slide). The problem is presented, but it is not necessary to explain it if it is one of the proposed projects. Otherwise, it will be explained briefly, but without going into detail. 2. Description of the applied method. Algorithm design and parameterization for solving the problem in its two versions, GA and ES (2-4 slides). There is no need to explain the techniques of genetic algorithms and simulated cooling, or any other techniques discussed in class. The fundamental interest is the adaptation of the methods to the problem being solved. Specifically:  For GA: Briefly explain the solution coding (individuals), objective function, selection criteria, crossover and replacement, applied parameters, etc.  For ES: Solution coding (only if different from the previous one), definition of neighbors, applied parameters, etc. 3. Solution implementation or use of a general-purpose environment (1-2 slides). Language selection and brief implementation summary. 4. Evaluation. Test cases and comparative metrics. Discussion (3-4 slides). Present the analysis of the results using graphs/tables. The aim is not to present dozens of graphs, but rather a summary of the most notable results. The analysis of parameter variations and their impact on the solutions obtained, the diversity and scale of the test cases, and the quality of the solution versus generations/computation time will be assessed. The aim is not to have a definitive and optimal application, but rather an adequate analysis of the applicability of the metaheuristics to the problem at hand. 5. Conclusions (1 slide). Highlight the technique that was most effective and why. This section will be given special consideration, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the work completed. In addition to the content of the presentation, the following elements will be assessed:  Clarity in the selection and presentation of ideas. That is, whether the presentation effectively conveys the relevant information. This will be especially important if the presentation is recorded on video.  A properly prepared presentation, timed to the established time. Appropriate nonverbal communication (gestures, rhythm, intonation, calmness, and naturalness, among others).  As well as any cross-assessments that are carried out. Documentation to be uploaded to the Poliformat assignment and deadline A Poliformat assignment will be created for the submission of work (reports and presentations). For all students:  Upload the final presentation and report (.pdf format), executable code, and/or source code for the work completed, before 11:55 p.m. on 11:03 p.m. For students giving an in-person presentation in the lab:  During the presentation session, the form indicated by the professors (TMH Evaluation) must be filled out, evaluating three presentations that the professor will indicate. The deadline for completing this form is 11/03/2025 at 11:55 p.m. For students giving an asynchronous video-recorded presentation:  Link to the video before 10/23/2025 at 11:55 p.m.  The form indicated by the professors (TMH Evaluation) must be filled out, evaluating three presentation videos that the professor will indicate. Once the professor has the link to all the videos, he or she will send the list of the three videos to be evaluated to each student. The deadline for completing this form is 11/03/2025 at 11:55 p.m. Video Recording of the Presentation and Storage on the UPV Server The structure of the presentation
